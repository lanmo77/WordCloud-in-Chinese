# WordCloud-in-Chinese

This is an attempt to draw wordcloud in Chinese. The main aim for this is to celebrate my roommate's birthday so I took her weibo account as an example. Since the NLP packages in R in Chinese is still at a very early stage, so the overall style of this wordcloud is not that satisfying. I will continue to improve this part.
